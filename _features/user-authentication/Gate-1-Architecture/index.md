## Overview

Gate 1 generates complete system architecture documentation based on Gate 0 platform requirements. It includes high-level design, component diagrams, data models, API specifications, and deployment strategies.

## Core Documents

### Architecture Overview
[architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md)

Complete architectural vision including:
- System context diagram
- High-level architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture patterns
- Design principles

### System Design
[system-design.md](system-design.md)

Detailed system design covering:
- Component interactions
- Data flows
- Sequence diagrams
- State management
- Error handling strategies

### Gate 1 Summary
[GATE1-SUMMARY.md](GATE1-SUMMARY.md)

Executive summary of all Gate 1 outputs and decisions.

### Architecture README
[ARCHITECTURE-README.md](ARCHITECTURE-README.md)

Quick reference guide for the architecture documentation.

## What Gate 1 Does

1. **Analyzes** Gate 0 requirements
2. **Designs** system architecture
3. **Generates** component diagrams
4. **Creates** database ERD
5. **Specifies** API contracts
6. **Plans** deployment strategy

---

## Key Features

- ✅ Comprehensive architecture documentation
- ✅ Visual diagrams (Mermaid)
- ✅ Technology-specific designs
- ✅ Security-first architecture
- ✅ Scalable design patterns

---

## Statistics

- **250+ pages** of architecture documentation
- **50+ diagrams** (component, sequence, ERD, deployment)
- **30+ architecture decisions** documented
- **20+ patterns** applied
- **10+ subsystems** designed

---

## Next Gate

After Gate 1, proceed to:
- **Gate 1.5**: Cross-Validation - Validate consistency between Gate 0 and Gate 1, identify gaps

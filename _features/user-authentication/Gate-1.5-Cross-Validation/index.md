## Overview

Gate 1.5 performs critical cross-validation between requirements (Gate 0) and architecture (Gate 1). It identifies inconsistencies, missing requirements, architectural gaps, and potential implementation blockers before proceeding to detailed design.

## Validation Reports

### Blocker Identification
[blocker-identification.md](blocker-identification.md)

Critical blockers that must be resolved:
- Technical blockers
- Resource constraints
- Dependency conflicts
- Design limitations
- Integration challenges

### Dependency Analysis
[dependency-analysis.md](dependency-analysis.md)

Comprehensive dependency mapping:
- Component dependencies
- Service dependencies
- Third-party library analysis
- Version compatibility
- Licensing review

### Critical Path Analysis
[critical-path-analysis.md](critical-path-analysis.md)

Implementation critical path:
- Sequencing requirements
- Bottleneck identification
- Timeline estimates
- Resource allocation

### Risk Assessment
[risk-assessment.md](risk-assessment.md)

Project risk analysis:
- Technical risks
- Security risks
- Performance risks
- Integration risks
- Mitigation strategies

### Parallel Work Opportunities
[parallel-work-opportunities.md](parallel-work-opportunities.md)

Optimization recommendations:
- Parallelizable work streams
- Independent modules
- Team organization
- Velocity improvements

### Team Coordination Plan
[team-coordination-plan.md](team-coordination-plan.md)

Team structure and coordination:
- Team organization
- Communication plan
- Handoff procedures
- Collaboration tools

### Gate 1.5 Approval
